# freeCodeCamp Project Marathon

In addition to practicing leetcode-type problems on a near-daily basis, I decided to also practice the more practical side of development. Along came freeCodeCamp's weekly email with a link to a list of 40 quick `javascript`+`react`+`typescript` projects to complete. Most of them seem pretty novice, but some of them look quite interesting. I'll be documenting my progress here.
