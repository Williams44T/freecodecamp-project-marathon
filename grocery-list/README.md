# Grocery List

In this tutorial, you will learn how to update and delete items from a grocery list and create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application.

CRUD plays a very important role in developing full stack applications. Without it, you wouldn't be able to do things like edit or delete posts on your favorite social media platform.  

**Key concepts covered:**

- DOMContentLoaded
- new Date()
- createAttribute()
- setAttributeNode()
- appendChild()
- filter()
- map()
