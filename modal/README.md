In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a modal window which is used on websites to get users to do or see something specific.

A good example of a modal window would be if a user made changes in a site without saving them and tried to go to another page. You can create a modal window that warns them to save their changes or else that information will be lost.

**Key concepts covered:**

- document.querySelector()
- addEventListener()
- classList.add()
- classList.remove()
