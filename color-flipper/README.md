In [Leonardo Maldonado's article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whats-the-document-object-model-and-why-you-should-know-how-to-use-it-1a2d0bc5429d/#:~:text=Advantages,the%20page%20without%20a%20refresh.) on why it is important to learn about the DOM, he states:

>By manipulating the DOM, you have infinite possibilities. You can create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. Also, you can create applications that are customizable by the user and then change the layout of the page without a refresh.
